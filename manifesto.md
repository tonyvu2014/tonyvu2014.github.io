The personal values that I live with can be summarized as MPH.

## M for Meritocracy
May the best ideas win.
May the best people triumph and prevail.

## P for Pragmatism
White cat or black cat does not matter as long as it catches mouse.
Make practical decisions based on reality, not on whims or emotions.

## H for Honesty
Be brutally honest with yourself. 
Avoid disillusions.
