### MPH 
The personal values that guide my actions can be summarized as MPH. 

## M for Meritocracy
May the best ideas win.

May the best people triumph and prevail.

## P for Pragmatism
White cat or black cat does not matter as long as it catches mouse.

Make practical decisions based on reality, not on whims or emotions.

## H for Honesty
Be brutally honest with yourself. 

Avoid disillusions.


### Guiding Light

## Say No to Bullshit
Life is a mess. Bullshit is everywhere. 

Stay away from bullshit people and behaviours. 

Live life with joy.

## Take a driver's seat of your life
You are the designer of your life. 

Take full responsibility of your health, love and career.

## Patience, patience, patience
Patience is the virtue of the wise.

Good things take time.

Nothing good comes easy.
